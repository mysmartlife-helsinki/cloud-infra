*datahubhel* is an implementation of [EIP SCC Urban Data Platform](https://eu-smartcities.eu/initiatives/68/description) developed for the mySMARTLife project in Helsinki. It aims to act as a data platform for live data streams and temporal data stores. Overall, the data model is expected to support the [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/requirements-inspire-directive/64) by supporting the [ISO/TC 211](https://www.iso.org/committee/54904.html) whenever feasible.
